### Once CSS has been specified then it is only useful for us in developing web pages if one or more browsers have implemented it. This means that the code has been written to turn the instruction in our CSS file into something that can be output to the screen. We'll look at this process more in the lesson How CSS works. It is unusual for all browsers to implement a feature at the same time, and so there is usually a gap where you can use some part of CSS in some browsers and not in others. For this reason, being able to check implementation status is useful.




# External CSS
### With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
### Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.
